                    This proverb is saying that when somebody gives something they receive even more, but when somebody doesn't give at all they lose everything.  People who give open themselves up to the graciousness of others and may recieve even more then they gave, this could even just be love or friendship.
                    On the other hand, people that do not give cut themselves off and do not receive as much.

                    This is seen in society because people teach the newer generations the things that humanity has learned through the education system and this leads to an educated society that can give back to and create things to take care of the generation that taught them. Through their giving of knowledge,
                    the people that teach the future generations receive more than they even gave.

                    When you give material possessions to people, it only has a minor and short-lived effect on them. The things that truly has a big effect is when you give people

                    An example of this is the old saying, <em>"give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"</em>, this means that giving the knowledge
                    of how to fish is much more impactful than just giving him a possession because the knowledge allowed him to eat for his lifetime.

                    This proverb explains how if you give your seeds to a farmer, he can create even more seed and also create food out of it. This now only applies to this situation though, the basic idea

                    This Serbian proverb explains that you should always work at a job at this moment if possible and that you should not leave it off for tomorrow. Leaving off tasks till tomorrow causes
                    laziness in society and if many people went at this practice, it could be devastating to society.

                    This Japenese proverb is explaining how working together is always better that working alone. This is because the collective creativity and intellect of a group is always greater than that

                    This quote tells of how a crime can be justified if the intent was right. This means that, perhaps, the punishment should be lessened for crimes like this or the punishment should

                    An example of this could be murdering who was going to murder two other people. Your intent was to save two lives, but in some places this would still be illegal, technically.

                <p id="explanation">
                    This quote explains how a punishment that a criminal must deal with is the guilt that he did the crime. In many cases, this is even greater that the jail time they serve because it tears them appart 
                    emotionally for there whole lives, depending on the severity of the crime.

                <p id="example">
                    An example of this is an old person that is serving a life sentance for a murder he committed as a young person, 30 years ago. He has probably already stopped caring about being jailed and instead has the guilt 
                    that he murdered someone. It sticks around forever and can eat a person up.

                <p id="explanation">
                    In many cases, giving the death sentance for a punishment is less harsh than the alternatives. This may be because there is extreme guilt eating at the person and that leads to the person 
                    wanting to die.
                </p>
                
                <p id="example">
                    An example of this is a serial killer who has realized his mistakes. Living with his guilt for 30 years in jail would most likely be much easier than just getting the death sentance and dying.
                    Also, the person could benefit society still if he is alive.

                    This quote from the Prophet explains how you can only truly be free when you desire it or work towards it. This could be because otherwise you have never known what it is like to

                    This proverb shows how it is worth it to make sacrifices in order to gain or keep your freedom. This is because the benefits of freedom are so great that there are little things that can

                    An example of this is taxes in the free world. It is necessary to have them because when everyone is free, things become more expensive for the government to do. This results in taxes being collected

                    Death is an inevitable occurance that should not be feared. Passing into eternity could mean going to heaven or it could just be having yourself lived on in the thoughts and memories
                    of people for centuries, if you were important enough.

                    An example of this would be William Shakespeare. He definitly did die, but he is living on for eternity through the memory of himself and his work because he was that important for the 
                    English language.

                    We should focus on living life rather than thinging about death. We find the end of live so tragic, but we do not see the waste of life, one third in sleep, as nearly as tragic. However, 
                    we should because death makes every second of life matter even more.

                    An example of this is a person who only thinks about life and does not let the fear of death hinder what they do in life. The fear of death would only motivate them to make every second of life 
                    ever more enjoyable.

                    The inevitability of death should be a motivation to always follow your heart, because everything ends the same way anyway, and it means that you have nothing to lose. If you have nothing to lose then there is no point in holding yourself 
                    back.

                    An example of this is the life of the man that said the quote, Steve Jobs, his small garage startup company has become one of the most influential and dominated companies in the tech market because he never held back.
